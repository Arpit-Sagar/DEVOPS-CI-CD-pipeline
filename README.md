# DEVOPS-CI-CD-pipeline
Implementation of Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker to steamline the process of integration and deployment.

The CI/CD pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and 
deploying code changes. As soon as developers push changes to the code 
repository, the pipeline will trigger a build and run automated tests to ensure 
that the code is of high quality.

Uses AWS servers(EC2 instances),Jenkins Jobs,Putty configuration Tool,Docker container and GitHub for Repo production.
